# Call Sheet Manager App

### Why?
Seeing a need for this application we built a Call Sheet Manager to streamline an administrative task allowing the user to continue to focus on creative endeavors. The Call Sheet Manager project began life as a simple app to take care of the ever so tedious production management obligation for the creation of call sheets for a film or photo shoot, or an event.  This is a Phase 2 Project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering 15 week program, Q1 2022.

### Where is the project now?
Currently the project is stabilized, but still in production.  

### How?
Built on REACT with Material UI the app allows users to create and manage staff records, create and manage upcoming events, and then populate the screen with relevant information.  PDF export capability, and Call Sheet save function are still in development but will be coming soon. 

### Moving forward?
To date, attempts to incorporate external API libraries for weather and location data proved difficult in production, whether it be an outdated library or the ownership barring use of data. We are looking forward to exploring more libraries and incorporating them in our application as the libraries catch up to the React update that occurred in Dec 2021.
